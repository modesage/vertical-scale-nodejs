# Node.js Vertical Scaling with Cluster – Explained with Analogy

## 🧠 What is Vertical Scaling in Node.js?

Node.js is single-threaded by default. This means that:

- It handles only **one request at a time** per process when executing CPU-intensive tasks.
- As a result, **concurrent** heavy requests can block each other.

To make use of **multiple CPU cores** on a machine and improve concurrency, Node.js provides the built-in `cluster` module.

## 🏪 Analogy: Clothing Store Billing Counter

Imagine a clothing store with a single billing counter.

- A customer has to wait if someone else is being billed.
- Billing takes time (like a CPU-intensive task in Node.js).
- Others have to wait in line until the counter is free.

### ❓What happens if we add more billing counters?

- More customers can be billed **at the same time**.
- Each counter works at the **same speed**, but the **overall throughput** increases.
- This is like spawning multiple **Node.js worker processes** using the `cluster` module.

📌 So remember:

> **Clustering in Node.js is like adding more billing counters, not making them faster.**

## ⚙️ How Does Cluster Work?

- The **primary process** creates **child worker processes** using `cluster.fork()`.
- Each **worker runs your app code** and handles requests.
- In modern Node.js on Unix/Linux:
  - The **primary process owns the port** (e.g., `3000`).
  - It **delegates incoming TCP connections** to workers using **round-robin**.
- There is **no port conflict**, as the workers don’t bind directly — they get connections from the primary.

### Example Workflow

1. Worker 1 handles Request 1.
2. Worker 2 handles Request 2.
3. Worker 3 handles Request 3 (if W1 and W2 are still busy).

---

## 📈 What Does This Achieve?

- **Increased concurrency**: More requests can be handled at the same time.
- **No speed improvement per request**: Each worker still runs single-threaded JavaScript.

### 🚫 Clustering does NOT

- Make your code run faster.
- Parallelize individual heavy computations.

## 🚀 What If You Want to Speed Up Tasks?

For improving **raw performance of a single CPU-bound task**, consider:

- ✅ `worker_threads` – true multithreading inside a single process.
- ✅ Offloading to job queues like **BullMQ**, **RabbitMQ**, etc.
- ✅ Writing performance-critical code in **Rust/C++** via Node.js addons or WebAssembly.

🧠 Why requests go to the same PID from the same browser

It’s because of TCP connection reuse via HTTP keep-alive.
The browser keeps the connection open and reuses it, so Node.js routes it to the same worker process that originally handled it.
